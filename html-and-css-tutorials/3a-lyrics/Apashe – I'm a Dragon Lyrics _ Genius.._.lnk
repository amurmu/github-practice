	<p> [Verse 1: Sway]
	We put in practice and discipline
	No giving up, no giving in
	We're match fit, we're here to win
	For those who don't know better fill them in, fill them in
	Information, information
	We're the realest out here, no imitation	
	Been all around the world, no immigration
	And we getting in without an invitation
	[Bridge: Sway]
	Sound travels and the ground shakes
	And our society has got us on a wild chase
	Tell 'em we'll be back in sixty seconds with the loud bass
	We're moving at our pace, yeah
	[Verse 2: Sway]
	Yeah, keep saying stuff
	The boy linked up with Sway and stuff
	C8 to the UK and stuff
	Got 'em all on the floor like a praying monk
	What's the tempo, what's the tempo?
	Cut from the same cloth, what we do with info?
	And we ain't gonna wait for no invitation
	Before we get involved
	See, I'm never gonna suffer, put 'em on a sound wave
	All over the earth we can make the ground shake
	Ever since birth it was word to the (?)
	Just wanted to rap and make the crowd say
	We got information, information
	We're the realest out here, no imitation
	Been all around the world, no immigration
	And we getting in without an invitation
	[Chorus: Sway]
	Bounce with me, bounce! Bounce!
	[Hook: Sway]
